# Pocket
Simple command-line app for monitoring pocket usage/auto updating article list using Pocket's API. 

Note that as of now this is not really an application so much as a tool for me personally to better manage my Pocket account, and a fun personal project. It won't work "out of the box," but you're welcome to grab the source and play around with it if you want.
